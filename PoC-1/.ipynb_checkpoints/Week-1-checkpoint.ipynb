While you will see some Python programmers do this, you should not comment your code by putting a multi-line string in the middle of your program. That is not actually a comment, rather it is just a string in the middle of your program!\n",

Because the Python language does not actually support constants, by convention, Python programmers use global variables with names that are in all capital letters for constants. When you see a variable with a name in all capital letters, you should always assume that it is a constant and you should never change it. Again, such global constants are the only global variables that will be allowed in this class."
